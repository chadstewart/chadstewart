# I‚Äôm Chad Stewartüëã

I‚Äôm Chad Stewart, a Software Engineer from Kingston, Jamaica. I‚Äôve done Front-End Engineering for the last 10+ years working at various organizations, from startups to enterprises. Outside of Software Engineering, I‚Äôm an amateur eSports athlete, primarily playing Capcom‚Äôs Street Fighter series of fighting games, currently Street Fighter 6.

I also try to make people laugh on occasion... sometimes successfully ü§£ 

## What I'll be doing moving forward

What I‚Äôll be doing for the foreseeable future is to explore working on Front-End dev tooling as well as exploring working on apps on a much larger-scale. Also I‚Äôd like to explore building apps and tools for the eSports and gaming community.
